# CalHacksTopographyGraphTraversal

SafePath

A novel, general purpose approach to detecting safe paths using topographic modeling and Google Cloud API.
Using Python, Google Cloud Elevation API, and Tkinter/PIL.

Problem Statement #1 - Navigating and reading topographical maps are a pain for off trail hikers
Topographical maps are tough to read, especially for beginners. Our software helps hikers find the most efficient path to traversing any terrain. 
Given impassable terrain (e.g. Patches of poison ivy or thorny bushes, rivers, private property), the user can easily block out said terrain and 
recalculate the fastest path

Problem Statement #2 - Wheel-chair/Disability Accessibility
Users with physical disabilities can utilize the app in more focused areas such as hilled parking lots or walking paths to find the easiest path to their destination
If there is a ledge that the user cannot access using a wheelchair, crutches, or given mode of transportation, the user can block the 
area out.
